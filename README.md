**3. User Experience:**

Improve the user experience:
Add loading indicators while fetching data.

Consider adding a default city or recent searches functionality.
**4. Code Formatting:**

Use consistent indentation and spacing for better code readability.
Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious parts of the code.
