API Key
This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API. You'll need to sign up for a free API key at OpenWeatherMap and replace the apiKey variable in js.js with your own key.

Future Improvements
Modularize the Code:

Break down functionality into separate JavaScript functions for better readability and maintainability.
Create functions for fetching data, updating UI elements, handling errors, and setting weather icons.
Error Handling:

Implement more robust error handling.
Check for network errors or invalid API responses.
Display user-friendly error messages for different scenarios.
User Experience:

Add loading indicators while fetching data.
Debounce the search functionality to avoid excessive API calls while typing.
Consider adding a default city or recent searches functionality.
Code Formatting:

Use consistent indentation and spacing for better code readability.
Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious parts of the code.
External Libraries:

Explore using a JavaScript library like Axios for cleaner API interaction.
Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap for easier styling and responsiveness.
